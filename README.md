# FFT Example

This repository serves as an example for [Yuyu378's FFTpack](https://github.com/Yuyu378/FFTpack). I have simplified the header and made some code modifications. You can extend this library to suit your specific application.

## What I edited

- Add dsp library (updating)
- Focused the library on FFT operations
- 2d fft operations (for DIP)

## Instructions
To get started, you can clone this repository and run the `main.c` file in your preferred IDE. I recommand you use the CodeBlock which is the IDE I usually used.

## Content
- Complex Fundamental Operations
- FFT Algorithms (for any Length)
- Some DSP Operations

## Application

For fundamental FFT, it can only operate on lengths that are powers of 2. Yuyu378 has implemented a general version for FFT of any length, allowing you to use it for various DSP applications, such as convolution.
